# Auger data analysis scripts

This repository contains a series of scripts in C++ featuring CERN's ROOT library for data analysis.
The scripts are used to plot and extract some quantities from large datasets called TTrees.
Some of these scripts are used to try to select traces not containing lightning-induced noise by the means of combination of thresholds.
See each file for more details.

## Data

The original datasets used in these scripts are not included, due to size and availability constraints.

## Status

This is a personal, static collection of scripts and is not intended for active development or external contributions.
